java-apns is a Java client for Apple's Push Notification Service (APNS).
The library is new BSD License.

Features:
  * Ease to use, high performance APNS Service API
  * Easy to use with Apple's certificates
  * Easy to extend
  * Easy to integrate with dependency injection

The library is built with dependency injection in mind.  While it provides
a clean simple API, it is extensible and all components should be reusable.


Sample code:

    ApnsService service =
        APNS.newService()
        .withCert("/path/to/certificate.p12", "MyCertPassword")
        .withSandboxDestination()
        .build();

    String msg = APNS.alert("Check your email!").sound("default").build();
    String deviceToken = "fedfbcfb....";
    service.push(token, msg);
